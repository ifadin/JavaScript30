    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team = Array.from(players);
    team[2] = 'team';

    // one way
    const team1 = players.slice();
    team1[2] = 'team1';

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team2 = [].concat(players);
    team2[2] = 'team2';

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team3 = [...players];
    team3[2] = 'team3';

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    console.clear();
    console.log(players);
    console.log(team);
    console.log(team1);
    console.log(team2);
    console.log(team3);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const name = {first: 'some', last: 'last', shallow: {field: false}};

    // and think we make a copy:
    console.log(name);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const name1 = Object.assign({}, name, {lang: 'en'});

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    //    const name2 = {...name};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    name1.shallow.field = true;
    console.log(name1);
    console.log(name);
